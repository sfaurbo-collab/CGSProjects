// Objective: Work with file I/O, 2D arrays, and nested loops to create a simple maze renderer.
// 1. Write a program that :
//	- Loads the contents of the provided Maze.txt file into a 2D array.
//	- Draws the loaded maze into the console using nested loops.
// Optional Extension :
//	- Add a function to find a path from the Start(S) to the End(E) in the maze.
//	- Modify the maze to include the path and display it in the console.
